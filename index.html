            <p>My path has been defined by persistence through challenges. Starting with difficult early school years, I discovered entrepreneurship as a channel for my creativity and problem-solving abilities. During 11th grade, I incorporated my first startup, Advista Marketing Private Limited, while managing the complexities of adolescence and education.</p>
            
            <p>Family responsibilities presented significant tests that ultimately strengthened my resolve. These experiences gave me unique insights into business resilience and adaptability. My family's industrial background provided me with valuable exposure to large-scale operations and supply chain management from an early age.</p>
            
            <p>Each challenge has shaped my perspective as an entrepreneur, reinforcing my commitment to creating practical solutions that address real-world problems. Today, my vision extends to building Advista into India's synonymous name for procurement services and developing Dhanda Studio into a transformative retail network that benefits both store owners and consumers across the country.</p>
            
            <p>This journey continues to inform my approach to technology and business development as I work to create systems that merge technological innovation with practical business applications.</p>
